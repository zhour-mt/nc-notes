Creating and Inserting Data
Creating a database

The following SQL statement creates a database called "my_database":

CREATE DATABASE my_database;

Dropping a database

To drop a database (if it exists), including all tables and records, use the DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS query:

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS my_database;

Creating a table

To create a table inside a database, the name of the table must be specified, as well as the table's column names and their data types.

The following statement will create a table of Northcoders, where the Primary Key of each row is an id:

CREATE TABLE northcoders (
  northcoder_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  northcoder VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  date_of_birth DATE,
  northcoders_points INT DEFAULT 0
);

NOT NULL prevents the creation of a row without a value in the specified column.

DEFAULT allows a default value to be set if one is not provided when a row is added to the table.
Inserting into a table

Data can be inserted into the table using the following statements:

INSERT INTO northcoders
  (northcoder_id, northcoder)
VALUES
  (1, 'Callum');

Multiple records can be inserted in one statement by separating the entries with commas:

INSERT INTO northcoders
  (northcoder, date_of_birth)
VALUES
  ('Callum', '1992-05-17'),
  ('Ali', null),
  ('Kev', '1826-10-24'),
  ('Rayhaan', null);
