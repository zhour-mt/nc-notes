NPM Scripts

Scripts are used to allow shorthand terminal commands.

Most scripts will be configured in the package.json file that npm init creates. NPM scripts are written as JSON key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the script and the value contains the script to be executed.

A common example is:

"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}

This script specifies that when npm test is run in the command line, it should run the Jest npm package that is installed in the node_modules directory.

A script to use node to run the listen.js file would look like this:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "node listen.js"
}

This script would be run with the following command: npm run dev. This is the equivalent of running node listen.js in the terminal.

The word run is needed here, because dev is not a predefined npm script in the way that test is.
