Data Types and Variables

There are eight data types in JavaScript:

    string - a series of characters surrounded by quotation marks.
    number - includes integers (whole numbers) and floating points (decimal numbers).
    boolean - a value that is either true or false.
    undefined - something that has no specified value.
    null - null a value used to represent an empty or unknown value.
    symbol - represents a unique identifier that can be used in various ways.
    bigInt - a special numeric type used to represent large numbers.
    object - a collections of values and behaviours which represent a complex entity.

Variables

A variable is used to store a piece of data or information. To declare a variable, you use a keyword of either let or const.

let is used for a variable you will reassign or add to. To reassign a variable, use the variable name and the assignment operator (=) to assign it a new value.

const is used when you will not be reassigning the value. If you try, JavaScript will throw an error when the code is run.

let currentMood = "happy";
currentMood = "excited";

currentMood; // "excited"

const daysInAWeek = 7;
daysInAWeek = 13; // error thrown 

daysInAWeek; // 7

You can use variables to store various pieces of information:

const firstWord = "hello northcoders".slice(0, 6);

Let's break this down:

    const - the keyword which indicates you are creating a new variable.
    firstWord - the identifier, or name, of the variable.
    = - the assignment operator which is used to assign a value to your variable.
    "hello northcoders".slice(0, 6) - the expression which will be assigned to firstWord.

It is worth noting that you can also declare variables with var. You may see cases of this in examples online. However, var is now obsolete and best avoided.
