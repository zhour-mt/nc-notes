Comparison and Logical Operators
Truthy & Falsy

When a value is encountered within a Boolean context, JavaScript will coerce it to either true or false. A truthy value is one which is coerced to true. A falsy value is coerced to false.

All values are considered truthy, except for false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined and NaN.

Additional information on type coercion can be found in the MDN docs.
Operators
Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return either true or false depending on the result.

    === - Strict equality
    !== - Strict inequality
    > - Greater than
    >= - Greater than or equal
    < - Less than
    <= - Less than or equal

Logical AND Operator

The logical AND operator, &&, evaluates to a Boolean after checking two values. If both values are truthy, it evaluates to true, if one or both values are falsy it evaluates to false.

1 && 2; // true
0 && 1; // false

Logical NOT Operator

The logical NOT operator, !, is used to either invert a Boolean value or to invert the truthiness of a non-Boolean value.

!false; // true

const trueWords = "I am always truthful!";
!trueWords; // false

Logical OR Operator

The logical OR operator, ||, evaluates to a Boolean after checking two values. If one or both values are truthy, it evaluates to true, if both values are falsy it evaluates to false.

1 || 2; // true
0 || 1; // true
0 || null; // false
