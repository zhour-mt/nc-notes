Objects

An object is a data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs called properties. Objects are good data structures for representing a thing. Characteristics of the thing, which have no meaningful order, are stored and accessed as properties. They can be declared using curly brackets.

 const tutor = {
    name: "Heather", 
    age: 29, 
    interests: ["coding", "dancing", "watching Real Housewives"],
    isCool: true
 };

A key must be a string whereas values can be any data type, including other objects. Keys must be unique.
Accessing Properties
Dot Notation

Accessing properties refers to the process of "looking up" or accessing property values using a property key.

const pet = { name: "Lily", age: 10};

pet.name; // "Lily"

pet.starsign; // undefined

You can access a property's value from an object by using the object name and the key of the property you want to access. This is most commonly achieved using dot notation. Accessing a property using a key which does not exist will evaluate to undefined.
Dynamic Access

Alternatively, you can use a variable and square bracket notation to access a property.

const phoneBook = {
  david: "07986538201",
  linda: "07891867541",
  heather: "0789573421",
};

const name = "linda";

phoneBook.name; // undefined
phoneBook[name]; // "07891867541"

phoneBook["DAVID".toLowerCase()]; // "07986538201"

The variable or expression inside the square brackets is evaluated and then used as the key to access the associated property value.
Adding and Deleting Properties

To add a property to an existing object, you can assign the value using dot notation. As keys must be unique, assigning a value to a property which already exists will update the property's value rather than create a new property.

phoneBook.jim = "07586548207";

// {
//   david: "07986538201",
//   linda: "07891867541",
//   heather: "0789573421",
//   jim: "07586548207"
// };

To delete a property from an object, use the delete operator. The delete operator removes both the value and the property from the object.

delete phoneBook.linda;
delete phoneBook.heather;
delete phoneBook.david;

// {
//   jim: "07586548207"
// };

Making changes to an object is called mutation.
