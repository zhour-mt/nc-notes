CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a style sheet language that defines the presentation of structured documents. A CSS file tells the browser how to display elements within the linked HTML document.
Linking CSS to HTML

To apply CSS styling, create a link between your HTML and CSS files. Include a <link> tag within the <head> section of your HTML, with a href attribute that contains the path to the CSS file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

CSS Selectors

A CSS ruleset targets elements based on a selector. Common selectors include element selectors, class selectors and ID selectors.
Element Selector

The most basic selector targets a specific HTML element. For example, all <p> elements can be targeted using:

p {
  /* Your styling rules here */
}

Class Selector

Classes provide a way to group elements and style them consistently. Multiple elements can share the same class name. Classes can be defined in HTML by using the class attribute:

<ul class="links-list">
  <li>W3Schools</li>
  <li>MDN</li>
</ul>

To apply styles to elements with a specific class, use the class selector (.) and class name:

.links-list {
  /* Your styling rules here */
}

ID Selector

IDs are used to uniquely identify individual elements. IDs can be denoted in HTML by using the id attribute.

<h1 id="page-title">Welcome to Our Website</h1>

Use the ID selector (#) and ID name to apply styles to the specific element:

#page-title {
  /* Styling rules for element with ID "page-title" */
}

Documentation for other selectors can be found on MDN.
CSS Hierarchy

The order in which CSS rulesets are written matters. When two rulesets are applied to an element with the same selector, the last ruleset will take precendence.

When multiple rulesets are applied to an element with different selectors, the order of priority is as follows:

    Inline styles, e.g. <h1 style='color: pink;'>
    IDs, e.g. <h1 id='main-header'>
    Classes, e.g. <h1 class='heading'>
    Elements, e.g. using the h1 element selector

CSS Resets

Different browsers will apply default styling to an HTML document if there is no CSS provided. To have full control over our CSS styles, a CSS reset can be used to provide default styling to all elements using the wildcard selector *:

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: 0;
}

This should be applied at the top of the CSS file, so that any other style rulesets will override it as needed.
