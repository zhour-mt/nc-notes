HTML

HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard coding language for crafting web pages. It uses tags to define the structure and components within a document. Each element in an HTML document instructs the browser on how to display its contents.
HTML Structure

In general, every HTML file follows a standard structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
    <head>
        <title>Title goes here</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>

    <!DOCTYPE>: Located at the top of a HTML file, this helps the browser to display the web page correctly in HTML.
    <html>: Contains the project scope and language, e.g. 'en' for English.
    <head>: Sets the document's title and may hold additional meta data about the page.
    <body>: Where the main content, like paragraphs and headers, is placed.

HTML Tags

HTML labels its elements with tags, which are identified by the angle brackets around them. Most HTML elements have a start tag (e.g. <p>), followed by content, and then an end tag (</p>). Some tags are self-closing, meaning that they do not have a separate start and end tag, such as <img/>.

Common tags include:

    <h1>: Represents the primary header, typically the page title.
    <h2>: Represents a secondary header, slightly smaller than <h1>.
    <p>: Defines a paragraph of text.
    <ul>: Creates an unordered list with <li> list items.
    <ol>: Produces an ordered list.
    <img>: Embeds an image with attributes like src (image source) and alt (description).

Documentation for additional tags can be found on W3Schools or MDN.
Semantic HTML

HTML tags can be semantic (e.g. <article>, <header>, <form>) or non-semantic (e.g. <div> or <span>). Semantic tags convey content meaning, making it easier to know the purpose of a given HTML element. This also helps to enhance search engine visibility and accessibility for users of assistive technologies.
