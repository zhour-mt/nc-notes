CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. This is done through HTTP headers that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information from a web browser.
Enabling CORS in an Express API

When attempting to access your Express backend API from a web app, a CORS error message will occur. This is because, by default, Express blocks requests from domains other than the one it's hosted on.

To enable CORS for a backend API, begin by installing the cors package:

$ npm install cors

In the app.js file, import the package:

const cors = require('cors');

Within the app.js file, integrate the cors middleware before any other middleware or routers.

app.use(cors());

After implementing these changes, commit and push them to ensure they take effect in the hosted API:

$ git add app.js
$ git commit -m 'allow cross origin resource sharing'
$ git push origin main

More information about using the cors package can be found in the Express documentation.
